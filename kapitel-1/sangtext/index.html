    <h1>Believer</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
     <p>First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
        I'm fired up, and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
        The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
        Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be<br>
        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
        The master of my sea, oh-ooh</p>
    
     <p>I was broken from a young age<br>
        Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
        Writing my poems for the few<br>
        That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me<br>
        Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
        Taking my message from the veins<br>
        Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
        Seeing the beauty through the</p>
     <p>Pain!<br>
        You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive it came from<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
     <p>Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
        All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh<br>
        Your spirit up above, oh-ooh</p>
     <p>I was choking in the crowd<br>
        Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
        Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
        Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
        But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'<br>
        Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down<br>
        It rained down like</p>
       <p>Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive it came from<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
     <p>Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
        You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
        The blood in my veins, oh-ooh</p>
     <p>But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'<br>
        Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down<br>
        It rained down like</p>
     <p>Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>
     <p>Pain!<br>
        You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer<br>
        Pain!<br>
        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
        My life, my love, my drive it came from<br>
        Pain!<br>
        You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p>

    <p>Jordan Edward Benjamin, born october 25, 1993 and is also known as Grandson.</p>
    <p>He has made good amount of music i love to listen to and is an American Canadian singer, songwriter and a rapper.</p>
    <p>Some examples of the songs he has made are "Blood // Water (Blood in the water)","Bury Me Face Down" and "Something To Hide", which i will talk about</p>
   
    <h2>Blood // Water</h2>
    <td><img src="./Bilder/OIP (1).jpg" alt=""></td>
    <p>This song is about corporate greed and political corruption, culminating in environmental degradation. Together with “War,” “Blood // Water” boosted grandson’s popularity to what it has become today.</p>
    <p>This song and grandson himself were further exposed to a wider audience when it was featured in Episode 21 of Season 2 (“Judgment Night”) of the insanely-popular teen drama show Riverdale. It was also the theme for NXT Takeover: Brooklyn 4, which further increased its popularity.</p>
    <p>The single quickly became the most popular component of his “a modern tragedy vol. 1” project, and his biggest record thus far.</p>
    <p>Due to its success, 5 official remixes have been released as well as an acoustic version and a live version (part of his Garage Gigs Live) project. The song has garnered more than 500 million streams on Spotify and peaked at #19 on Billboard Top Rock Songs Chart on September 22nd, 2018.</p>

    <h3>Bury Me Face Down</h3>
    <td><img src="./Bilder/OIP (3).jpg" alt=""></td>
    <p>This is a defiant anthem for the underdog. The song's protagonist has been on the run, counted out and left for dead, yet he refuses to go down without a fight. He's not just planning to resist his enemies; he's declaring war on them. When he says "bury me face down," it signifies his
    rebellious spirit even in death, refusing to be silenced or submissive. The mention of bringing his crown into the ground suggests that he retains his dignity and self-respect despite the struggles. It is a powerful message about resilience, defiance, and standing up against adversity no matter how insurmountable it may seem.</p>

    <h3>Something To hide</h3>
    <td><img src="./Bilder/M_grandson_040623.jpg" alt=""></td>
    <p>The song talks about addiction, mental health, and trauma through the lens of his family and upbringing. He got their blessing to release the song, so he decided to release it, hoping it would relate to someone.
       “This song is probably the most confessional song I’ve written,” says grandson to Ghetto Blaster Magazine.</p>
